## Introduction

A Clojure library that wraps [Alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda) so you can write musical scores as edn data.

## Usage

You can include this library in your project dependencies using the version number in the badge above.

To experiment with this library in a REPL, you can use [the Clojure CLI tool](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools). In this directory, run `clj` to start a Clojure REPL. When the REPL is up, enter the main namespace with `(require 'edna.core) (in-ns 'edna.core)`.
